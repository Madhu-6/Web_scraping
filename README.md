# Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to scrape data from web pages using Python's BeautifulSoup library. The goal is to extract specific information and store it in a structured format for analysis.

## Features

- Extract data from HTML elements
- Handle pagination
- Save data to CSV/JSON
- Basic error handling

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `pandas` (optional, for saving data)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webscraping.git
   cd webscraping
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
   ```

## Usage

1. Open `scraper.py` and modify the following parameters as needed:
   - `URL`: The URL of the web page you want to scrape.
   - `ELEMENTS_TO_SCRAPE`: Specify the HTML elements you want to extract.

2. Run the scraper:

   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```

3. The scraped data will be saved to a file (CSV or JSON format based on your choice).

## Example

Here's a simple example of how to scrape article titles from a blog:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

# URL of the page to scrape
url = 'https://example-blog.com'

response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# Find all article titles
titles = soup.find_all('h2', class_='post-title')

# Extract text from the titles
data = [title.get_text() for title in titles]

# Save to a CSV file
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Title'])
df.to_csv('article_titles.csv', index=False)
```

## Error Handling

The scraper includes basic error handling to manage:
- Connection issues
- Missing elements
- Rate limiting
